# SEPA - SPARQL Event Processing Architecture

SEPA is a publish-subscribe architecture designed to support information level interoperability. The architecture is built on top of a generic SPARQL endpoint where publishers and subscribers use standard **SPARQL** Updates and Queries. Notifications about events (i.e., changes in the **RDF** knowledge base) are expressed in terms of added and removed SPARQL binding results since the previous notification.

## Installation

- Download the [SEPA Engine](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPA/releases/download/0.7.0/engine-0.7.0.rar) and run it: `java -jar engine-x.y.z.jar`

- Download [Blazegraph](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bigdata/files/latest/download) (or use any other SPARQL 1.1 Protocol compliant service) and run it as shown [here](https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_Start) 

## Configuration

The SEPA engine uses two JSON configuration files: `engine.jpar` and `endpoint.jpar` (included in the [SEPA Engine release](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPA/releases/download/0.7.0/engine-0.7.0.rar) distribution). 
The default version of `endpoint.jpar` configures the engine to use use a local running instance of Blazegraph as [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol Service](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol.html).
```json
{
	"parameters": {
		"host": "localhost",
		"ports": {
			"http": 9999
		},
		"paths": {
			"update": "/blazegraph/namespace/kb/sparql",
			"query": "/blazegraph/namespace/kb/sparql"
		},
		"methods": {
			"query": "POST",
			"update": "URL_ENCODED_POST"
		},
		"formats": {
			"update": "HTML",
			"query": "JSON"
		}
	}
}
```
The default version of  `engine.jpar` configures the engine to listen for for incoming [SPARQL 1.1 SE Protocol](http://wot.arces.unibo.it/TR/sparql11-se-protocol.html) requests at the following URLs:

1. Query: http://localhost:8000/query
2. Update: http://localhost:8000/update
3. Subscribe/Unsubscribe: ws://localhost:9000/subscribe
4. SECURE Query: https://localhost:8443/secure/query
5. SECURE Update: https://localhost:8443/secure/update
6. SECURE Subscribe/Unsubscribe: wss://localhost:9443/secure/subscribe 
7. Regitration: https://localhost:8443/oauth/register
8. Token request: https://localhost:8443/oauth/token
```json
{
	"parameters": {
		"timeouts": {
			"scheduling": 0,
			"queueSize": 1000,
			"keepalive": 5000,
			"http": 5000
		},
		"ports": {
			"http": 8000,
			"ws": 9000,
			"https": 8443,
			"wss": 9443
		},
		"paths": {
			"update": "/update",
			"query": "/query",
			"subscribe": "/subscribe",
			"register": "/oauth/register",
			"tokenRequest": "/oauth/token",
			"securePath" : "/secure"
		}
	}
}
```
The engine uses a JKS for storing the keys and certificates for [SSL](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6ek/index.html) and [JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) signing/verification. A default `sepa.jks` is provided including a single X.509 certificate (the password for both the store and the key is: `sepa2017`).

## Usage

The SEPA engine allows to use a user generated JKS. Run `java -jar engine-x.y.z.jar -help` for a list of options. The Java [Keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html) can be used to create, access and modify a JKS.

The SEPA engine is also distributed with a default [JMX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/javamanagement-140525.html) configuration `jmx.properties` (including the `jmxremote.password` and `jmxremote.access` files for password and user grants). Remember to change password file permissions using: `chmod 600 jmxremote.password`. To enable remote JMX, the engine must be run as follows: `java -Dcom.sun.management.config.file=jmx.properties -jar engine-x.y.z.jar`. Using [`jconsole`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html) is possible to monitor and control the most important engine parameters. By default, the port is `5555` and the `root:root` credentials grant full control (read/write).

## History

SEPA has been inspired and influenced by [Smart-M3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smart-m3/). SEPA authors have been involved in the development of Smart-M3 since its [origin](https://artemis-ia.eu/project/4-sofia.html). 

The main differences beetween SEPA and Smart-M3 are the protocol (now compliant with the [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol.html)) and the introduction of a security layer (based on TLS and JSON Web Token for client authentication). 

All the SEPA software components have been implemented from scratch.
